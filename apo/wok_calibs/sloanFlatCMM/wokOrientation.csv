# defines the wok orientation in focal plane coordinates at zero position
# angle.  XYZ position is the location of the wok vertex in focal plane coords.
# Z position is measured from solid model.  XY position and XY tilts
# must be determined after installation on telescope with on sky testing.  If
# wok is aligned perfectly with the rotator XY position and XY tilts should be
# zero.  Tilt about x is applied before tilt about y.
